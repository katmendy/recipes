Ingredients:
 - 1 cup milk
 - 1 large egg
 - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for cooking
 - 1 cup all-purpose flour
 - 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
 - 1 teaspoon baking powder
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - Powdered sugar or maple syrup, for serving

Directions:
 1. Combine the ingredients in a wide-mouth jar. Place the milk, egg, and oil in a quart jar first. Add the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

 2. Seal the jar tightly and shake to combine. Seal the jar and shake the jar vigorously for at least 2 minutes. Donâ€™t stress about any small lumps in the batter.

 3. Set the batter aside while you heat a pan. Set the batter side for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.

 4. Fry 3 pancakes for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Add 2-tablespoon portions of the batter to the pan, cooking 3 at a time. Cook on the first side until bubbles appear on the surface, the edges begin to look dry, and the bottoms are golden-brown, about 3 minutes.

 5. Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancakes. Cook until the second sides are golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a warm oven or plate. Repeat using the remaining oil and cooking the remaining batter.
